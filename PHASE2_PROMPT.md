# sBTCPay - Week 6: Webhook System and Event Handling Implementation - COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary

The webhook system for sBTCPay has been successfully implemented with all the required components. Here's what was accomplished:

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- Created Event model and service for managing system events
- Implemented event creation, retrieval, and querying capabilities
- Added support for different event types (payment.created, payment.succeeded, payment.failed)

### 2. Webhook System
- Enhanced existing Webhook model and service with delivery and retry logic
- Implemented secure webhook dispatch with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- Added support for configurable event filtering

### 3. Webhook Delivery System
