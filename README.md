## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL client
- Redis client

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the database services:
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run init-db
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Merchant Management
- `POST /api/v1/merchants/register` - Register a new merchant
- `POST /api/v1/merchants/login` - Authenticate a merchant

### Payment Intents
- `POST /api/v1/payment-intents` - Create a new payment intent
- `GET /api/v1/payment-intents/:id` - Retrieve a payment intent
- `GET /api/v1/payment-intents/merchant/:merchantId` - List payment intents for a merchant

### Webhooks
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks` - Create a new webhook
- `GET /api/v1/webhooks/merchant/:merchantId` - List webhooks for a merchant
- `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/:id` - Delete a webhook
- `GET /api/v1/webhooks/:id/deliveries` - Get webhook delivery history
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/:id/retry` - Retry a failed webhook delivery
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/:id/test` - Send a test event to a webhook

## Webhook System

The webhook system provides real-time notifications for payment events:

### Supported Events
- `payment.created` - When a new payment intent is created
- `payment.succeeded` - When a payment is confirmed on the blockchain
- `payment.failed` - When a payment fails or expires
- `payment.refunded` - When a payment is refunded (if supported)

### Security Features
- HMAC-SHA256 payload signing for verification
- HTTPS enforcement
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive delivery tracking

For detailed documentation, see [Webhook Documentation](docs/webhooks.md)

## Development

### Backend

The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It uses PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for caching.

### Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain. They handle the core payment logic and ensure secure transactions.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```bash
npm test
```
